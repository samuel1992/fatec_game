# Running it locally
Im running this project into a python virtual env.
So its quite simple, just install the virtualenv (or not) and install the
requirements (it depends on python 3.6):
- pip install -r requirements
- python manage.py runserver

# Running it on docker
You must have docker and docker compose installed.
- `docker-compose up`

# Access
For access the admin just go to your localhost:8000/admin, thats all.
